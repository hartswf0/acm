# THE ANTI-CRISIS MACHINE

> "Four games walk into a crisis. Only one narrative walks out."

A collection of satirical tabletop card games that explore the friction economy of modern discourse—where outrage is currency, attention is extraction, and the medium really is the message.

---

## 🎮 The Four Games

### 1. TOTAL MELTDOWN
**The Culture War Simulator**

Force binary alignment on every issue. Generate outrage, monetize friction, and accelerate the discourse into total collapse.

| Card Type | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **SPARK** | Inciting incidents that force tribal alignment |
| **ACCELERANT** | Rhetorical weapons (Sealioning, Gish Gallop, Whataboutism) |
| **MONETIZATION** | Grift mechanics (Crypto pumps, Trad-wife courses, Rage-bait) |
| **FLUXUS** | Physical performance scores that break the social fiction |

**Files:** `tm-00.html`, `tm-01.html`, `tm-02.html`

---

### 2. DEW-LINE
**The McLuhan Oracle**

A Distant Early Warning system. Draw McLuhan probes and Fluxus scores—force pattern collisions until nonsense becomes signal.

| Card Type | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **PROBE** | 24 McLuhan aphorisms ("The medium is the message", "We march backwards into the future") |
| **FLUX** | 13 Fluxus-style performance instructions ("Do not swallow", "Weep like a willow") |

**Files:** `dew-00.html`, `dew-01.html`

### 3. THE FEED
**The Algorithm Simulator**

You ARE the algorithm. Inject crises, harvest engagement, and extract maximum value from the attention economy. Collapse is your win-state.

| Card Type | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **ALGORITHM** | Engagement mechanics (Rage Bait, Echo Chamber, Doomscroll) |
| **REALITY** | Real-world events with Heat values (Election Cycle, Police Incident, Tech Layoffs) |
| **BOT** | Counter-mechanisms (Fact Check, Touch Grass, Server Reset) |

**Files:** `the-feed-00.html`

### 4. EXPLAIN YOURSELF
**The Improv Defense Game**

Draw two incriminating EVIDENCE cards. Flip one corrupting SCENE card. You have **10 seconds** to explain why you're not guilty.

| Card Type | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **EVIDENCE** | 20 suspicious objects (Duct Tape, Ski Mask, Meat Cleaver, Rubber Chicken) |
| **SCENE** | 20 compromising locations (Airport Security, Grandma's Funeral, Job Interview) |
| **PROTOCOL** | 10 rules and theory cards explaining the Phantom Concept and Kinetic Defense |

## ⚡ THE ANTI-CRISIS PROTOCOL

**The Unified Metagame**

Play all four games together. Every card maps to one of five universal suits:

| Suit | Symbol | Source Types | Function |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **CRISIS** | ⚡ | SPARK, REALITY, SCENE | Inciting incidents with base Heat values |
| **VECTOR** | ◈ | ACCELERANT, ALGORITHM, PROBE | Amplification and distortion tools |
| **EXTRACTION** | ▣ | MONETIZATION | Convert friction to capital |
| **PERFORMANCE** | ⊗ | FLUXUS, FLUX | Physical scores that break the fiction |
| **ORACLE** | ∿ | PROBE, EVIDENCE, PROTOCOL | Pattern interrupts and forced interpretation |

### The 7-Phase Game Loop

1. **Crisis Injection** — Draw CRISIS card, establish base Heat
2. **Vector Application** — Attach VECTOR to amplify/deflect
3. **Oracle Consultation** — Force pattern collision with ORACLE
4. **Defense Window** — 10 seconds to EXPLAIN intervention
5. **Extraction/Judgment** — Jury votes: ACQUIT or CONVICT
6. **Bot Intervention** — If Crisis Track > 50, Bot applies Nuance
7. **Scroll** — Cards slide down, bottom card deleted, new round

### Win Conditions

- **Collapse Victory** — Crisis Track hits 100. Highest Revenue wins.
- **Pattern Singularity** — Correctly predict next Crisis using only Probes.
- **Teflon Status** — Achieve 5 consecutive Acquittals.
- **Society Heals** — Nuance exceeds Heat. The machine wins.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

All four games share a **friction economy**—they generate value from discomfort:

- **Meltdown** monetizes tribal conflict
- **DEW-Line** forces pattern recognition from noise
- **The Feed** harvests attention through anxiety
- **Explain Yourself** weaponizes social panic

The metagame makes this friction **visible and tradeable** through unified tokens:

| Token | Economy |
|-------|---------|
| **HEAT** | Friction / Radicalization |
| **REVENUE** | Extracted Capital |
| **NUANCE** | Bot Intervention |
| **AURA** | Social Credit |
