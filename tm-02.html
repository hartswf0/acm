                <h2>TOTAL MELTDOWN</h2>
                <p><strong>[SYSTEM PREMISE]:</strong> Information is infinite; attention is finite. You are an
                    Algorithmic Agent. Your success is measured by the velocity of outrage and the efficiency of
                    extraction.</p>

                <h3>I. OPERATIONAL PHASES</h3>
                <p><strong>1. THE INGESTION:</strong> The Architect draws one card from each Suit:
                    <strong>Spark</strong> (◆), <strong>Accelerant</strong> (◈), and <strong>Monetization</strong> (▣).
                </p>
                <p><strong>2. THE BROADCAST:</strong> You have 60 seconds to narrate the crisis. You must explain how
                    these three elements create a cohesive catastrophe.</p>
                <p><strong>3. THE SETTLEMENT:</strong> The Table (The Public) votes. A <strong>Thumbs Up</strong>
                    represents "Engagement." A <strong>Thumbs Down</strong> represents "Brain Rot."</p>

                <div class="model-box">
                    <strong>GAME THEORY: THE RAGE EQUILIBRIUM</strong>
                    <p>Architects face a "Tragedy of the Commons." Pitching repetitive crises causes the Public to lose
                        Focus (Game Ends). Pitching softly results in no Profit (You Lose). The optimal strategy is
                        <strong>Edge-Cynicism</strong>: reset the dopamine threshold without triggering total apathy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>II. TIE-BREAK: THE RATIO</h3>
                <p>If the vote is tied, execute a <strong>RATIO PIVOT</strong>. State one "Uncomfortable Truth" about
                    the round's crisis. If the table laughs or winces, you claim the engagement points.</p>

                <h3>III. FOCUS TOKENS</h3>
                <p>The Public starts with 5 <strong>Focus Tokens</strong>. Every majority Thumbs Down removes 1 Token
                    from the table. When tokens reach zero, the simulation ends. Highest <strong>Crisis Points</strong>
                    (Thumbs Up) wins the IPO.</p>
